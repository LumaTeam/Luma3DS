# Luma3DS
*Noob-proof (N)3DS "Custom Firmware"*

## What it is

**Luma3DS** is a program to patch the system software of (New) Nintendo 3DS handheld consoles "on the fly", adding features (such as per-game language settings and debugging capabilities for developers) and removing restrictions enforced by Nintendo (such as the region lock).

This is a fork of Aurora Wright's and TuxSH's Luma3DS software. My main goal with this fork is to develop more options for Rosalina loader, and experiment a bit.

## Compiling

First you need to clone the repository with: `git clone https://github.com/AuroraWright/Luma3DS.git`  
To compile, you'll need [armips](https://github.com/Kingcom/armips) and a build of a recent commit of [makerom](https://github.com/profi200/Project_CTR) added to your PATH. You'll also need to install [firmtool](https://github.com/TuxSH/firmtool), its README contains installation instructions.
For now, you'll also need to update your [libctru](https://github.com/smealum/ctrulib) install, building from the latest commit.  
For your convenience, here are [Windows](http://www91.zippyshare.com/v/ePGpjk9r/file.html) and [Linux](https://mega.nz/#!uQ1T1IAD!Q91O0e12LXKiaXh_YjXD3D5m8_W3FuMI-hEa6KVMRDQ) builds of armips (thanks to who compiled them!).  
Finally just run `make` and everything should work!  
You can find the compiled files in the `out` folder.
