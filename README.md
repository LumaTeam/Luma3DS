3DS CFW for N3DS


**Compiling:**

First you'll need the firmware file that I didnt include because reasons. Get that [HERE](https://www.dropbox.com/s/782eyz22lkmh434/firmware.bin?dl=0)

Secondly, You'll need armips added to your Path. [HERE](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ceuv2qeqp38lpah/armips.exe?dl=0) is a pre-compiled version.

Lastly, just run Make and everything should work!

Pre-compiled version can still be found on my [pastebin](http://pastebin.com/c5AW3TJp)
